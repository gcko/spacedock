## Problem

The pr-merge mod's PR-body audit link template is `[{entity-id}](/{owner}/{repo}/blob/{short-sha}/{path-to-entity-file})`. For sd-b32 workflows the rendered link is `[jaafh7xzz0va63rj6bgdgh3p](...)` — the 24-character stored ID, which:

1. Is unreadable in PR list / mobile / commit-message contexts
2. Doesn't match how operators or transcripts ever refer to the entity (we say `ja`, not the full hash)
3. Is the only sd-b32-specific render that doesn't already use the shortest-unique-prefix that `status` displays in its ID column

For sequential workflows (`[001]`) and slug-only workflows (`[restore-initial-prompt]`), the existing render is already short and readable. Only sd-b32 is broken.

## Captain direction (2026-04-30)

> edit pr mod to use short handles for id=sd-b32

This task captures that direction. Treat it as the ideation gate spec — captain has approved direction; implementation is the next step.

## Proposed approach

1. **Add a `status --short-id REF` flag** to `skills/commission/bin/status`. Returns the shortest-unique-prefix from active+archived for sd-b32 workflows; returns the literal stored ID for sequential and slug workflows. This keeps prefix-computation centralized in `status` (which already does it for the ID column) instead of forcing each consumer to re-derive it.
2. **Update both pr-merge mod copies** (`mods/pr-merge.md` and `docs/plans/_mods/pr-merge.md`) so the audit-link rendering step calls `status --short-id` and uses the result in the `[{entity-id}]` slot. Keep both files byte-identical (the `[Mod Install Freshness]` test from #197 enforces this).
3. **Add a `tests/test_status_short_id.py` host** with three parametric cases (sd-b32, sequential, slug) and one ambiguity case (sd-b32 with archived collision forcing prefix lengthening).

## Acceptance criteria

**AC-1 — `status --short-id REF` returns the shortest-unique-prefix for sd-b32, the stored ID for sequential and slug.**
Verified by: `tests/test_status_short_id.py` parametric cases. For sd-b32, asserts the returned prefix equals what `status` displays in its ID column. For sequential (`001`) and slug (`my-task`), asserts the returned value equals the literal stored ID.

**AC-2 — `status --short-id` lengthens the prefix when active+archived contain a colliding sibling.**
Verified by: `tests/test_status_short_id.py` ambiguity case. Two entities share a 2-char prefix; `--short-id` for each returns 3+ chars (whatever disambiguates).

**AC-3 — Both pr-merge mod copies are byte-identical after the update.**
Verified by: existing `[Mod Install Freshness]` check in `tests/test_commission.py` continues to pass after the edit.

**AC-4 — Both pr-merge mod copies' audit-link template references `status --short-id` (or equivalent) for the rendered ID slot.**
Verified by: grep both mod files; the prose in the audit-link instruction step mentions `--short-id` or the equivalent computation step that produces the short prefix.

**AC-5 — `make test-static` is green after the changes.**
Verified by: full static suite run.

## Test plan

1. Add `tests/test_status_short_id.py`:
   - sd-b32 fixture with one entity → `--short-id` returns 2-char prefix
   - sd-b32 fixture with two entities sharing a 2-char prefix → `--short-id` returns 3+ char prefix for each
   - sd-b32 fixture with active + archived collision → `--short-id` returns disambiguating prefix
   - sequential fixture → `--short-id` returns the numeric ID literal
   - slug fixture → `--short-id` returns the slug literal
2. The `[Mod Install Freshness]` byte-compare in `tests/test_commission.py` is the regression guard for AC-3.
3. `make test-static` after both changes.

## Out of scope

- Audit-link rendering for non-PR contexts (e.g., debrief output, status display) — those already use short prefixes in user-facing surfaces.
- Backfilling existing PRs (#155, #36, #179, etc.) with the new short rendering — those are historical and can stay as-is.
- Any change to `status --resolve` semantics — `--resolve` continues to return full stored IDs.

## Cross-references

- Filed alongside `06z0dycs40qr0a9b35waxaxf` (refit-docs-plans-readme) which the captain ordered in the same turn.
- The existing `[Mod Install Freshness]` byte-compare from #197 (PR #176) is the regression guard for AC-3.

### Feedback Cycles

**Cycle 1 — captain expanded scope at push-approval gate (2026-04-30 ~23:55 UTC).**

Cycle-1 implementation + validation passed against AC-1..AC-5 (short-id flag + mod audit-link uses it + byte-parity). When the FO presented the metadata-summary push-approval draft per the existing pr-merge mod prose, the captain asked for the full PR body draft instead of just the metadata. Inspecting the mod, its `## Hook: merge` pre-approval step explicitly specifies metadata only (Title / Branch / Changes / Files); the full templated body is only constructed *after* approval, so the captain never sees the prose that lands on GitHub before push.

This is a structural gap in the same mod `yv` already touches. Captain direction: **fold the fix into yv** rather than file a separate task.

**Added scope (cycle 2 — folded in):**

Update both pr-merge mod copies' `## Hook: merge` pre-approval step so the draft surfaced to the captain includes the **full templated PR body** (motivation lead + `## What changed` + `## Evidence` + audit link + `Closes` line if applicable), not just the metadata bullets. The existing post-approval body-construction step is removed (it was the same construction work, just done after approval) — body construction moves to the pre-approval draft and the post-approval step becomes a literal `gh pr create` with the already-constructed body. One round-trip with the captain instead of two; full visibility before push.

Implementation in cycle 2 keeps everything from cycle 1 (commit `e76527c6`) and adds a small mod-prose edit + two new tests.

**Added AC (folded into the existing AC list):**

**AC-6 — pr-merge mod's `## Hook: merge` pre-approval draft surfaces the fully-constructed PR body (template-rendered), not just metadata.**
Verified by: a new `tests/test_pr_merge_template.py` test asserts the `## Hook: merge` prose names "constructed PR body" / "templated body" (or equivalent) in the pre-approval step and does NOT name a separate post-approval body-construction step.

**AC-7 — Both pr-merge mod copies remain byte-identical after the cycle-2 edit.**
Verified by: `[Mod Install Freshness]` continues green after cycle-2; `diff mods/pr-merge.md docs/plans/_mods/pr-merge.md` returns empty.

**Cycle 2 dispatch context:** new implementation ensign in same worktree; cycle-1 commit stays. Append cycle-2 commit on top.
