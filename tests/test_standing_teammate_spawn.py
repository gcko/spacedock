    """AC-12/AC-14: standing: true mod spawns a teammate the FO can route to.

    Fixture declares one standing teammate (`echo-agent`) via
    `_mods/echo-agent.md`. Progressive per-step assertions ensure fail-fast
    diagnostics: each milestone names the step that stalled.

    Observable contract (FO-visible in fo-log.jsonl):
      1. TeamCreate emitted (teams-mode engaged).
      2. `claude-team spawn-standing` Bash invoked by FO.
      3. echo-agent Agent() dispatched (standing teammate spawn).
      4. Ensign Agent() dispatched; its prompt contains the standing-teammates
         section listing echo-agent (AC-14).
      5. Ensign Done: close observed via inbox-poll anchor.

    Ground-truth deliverable (post-run, on-disk):
      6. Archived entity body contains `ECHO: ping` — proof the ensign
         completed the SendMessage roundtrip and captured the echo reply.

    The ensign's internal SendMessage(echo-agent) and Edit(entity body) live
    in the ensign's subagent jsonl, not the FO stream, so they are not
    asserted as FO-visible tool_uses (unreachable under `claude -p` teams-mode
    per anthropics/claude-code#26426).
